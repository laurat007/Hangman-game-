  Program implementation took 18 hours approximately.
  The program receives as parameters many files from which
it reads in vectors printable characters, until '\n' occurs. 
  After openning ncurses window, a menu is displayed, from which 
the player can select one of the following options: New Game, Resume 
Game, Quit. Current option is marked by highlight and can be selected
with Enter.
  Once selected New Game, it enters a new window, with a control panel
in which date, time, number of expressions available, total number of 
characters and a few instructions come up.
  It is generated a number between 0 and the number of expressions 
in order to pick a random expression to be guessed. This one is split
in words, and each word is encoded by hangman rules.
  The player should pass a character in maximum 7 seconds, otherwise 
it will be generated a random character. If this one is part of the
original string it is shown, filling the blanks, but if it has been 
already tested, nothing happens. If there is a new wrong character
the hang appears on the screen. With each mistake, the player is shown 
its status.
  Game ends when the original string matches the completed one or when
the number of mistakes is 6. However, a message is sent and the player 
can now choose to stat a new game by pressing 'N' or to come back to 
main menu by pressing 'Q'.
  In addition to this, at each screen update the background color is 
changed.
